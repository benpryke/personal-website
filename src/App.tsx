          title="Bio"
          body="I build simple solutions to complex problems by working at the intersection of engineering and management. By connecting big ideas to small details, I strive to simplify implementations, polish user experiences, and uplift the people and technology around me.
Technology is about people first and code second. As writer of the world's most popular Jupyter Notebook tutorial for 5 years running, I am an expert in communicating technical concepts with a variety of audiences. I confidently lead complex technical deliveries, plan multi-stage projects, own roadmaps, scope tasks, and manage, coach, and mentor engineers.
Most of my recent experience is in the Python and JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystems, but I have been writing full stack code for over two decades, have a decade of experience in start-ups, large companies, and academia, and 8+ years in FinTech.
I'm working towards roles like Engineering Manager, Head of Engineering, CTO."

          body="Since 2020, I have worked with co-founder Natalie O'Neill to build Maeva, a product search engine that begins with a niche focus on the sunscreen market.
At Maeva, we believe that online product search no longer meets user needs. No company lets you search across all vendors with advanced filters that truly fit the product category. We value consistent, high quality data accessible via a wide range of tailored filters.
I am responsible for the technical implementation of the product vision, including the cloud architecture, data model, data pipeline, and user interfaces.
Key tech: Firebase, GCP, React, JavaScript, TypeScript, Express, Python, Pandas, Docker, NoSQL"
