          title="Story"
          body="I'm a highly driven full stack developer living and breathing the tech and FinTech startup worlds with a background in computer science and machine learning. I'm super excited by nascent and growth-phase companies, especially those using machine learning, as I'm motivated by being at the creative edge of new solutions.
Working in fast-paced startups has been perfect because I highly value diversity in my tasks and the freedom to make my own decisions and take ownership. I try to add value by understanding the bigger picture and actively engaging with projects at every level from roadmapping and architectural decisions, implementation minutiae and refactoring, to client demos and teaching. Right now, I mostly code with Python and React as these tools typically provide the most efficient and powerful routes to getting things done.
I still remember how I felt at 11 years old when my dad brought home a gigantic, discarded Windows 98 PC from work, so it's no surprise that less than a year later I had started programming. My teenage creative energy expenditure on Flash games, websites and physics simulations ultimately culminated in a Master's degree in Computer Science from Bristol University. From there I dove straight into a PhD in machine and deep learning at the University of Edinburgh before leaving to co-found a profitable boutique investment fund utilising that PhD skillset to find inefficiencies in niche markets. Realising both the long time horizon it would take to build reputation enough to obtain significant funding and the limitations of not being surrounded by other developers, I moved happily to London to join the FinTech startup Beacon.
Outside my primary work schedule, I make sure to push myself and learn in other ways such as writing data science articles, training gymnastics, and meeting others from the startup community to discuss the incredible things they're doing."

          imgSrc="images/logos/logo-beacon.jpg"
          body="Beacon Platform is a multi-award-winning FinTech start-up with international offices headquartered in New York, and in September 2017 I joined the London office. I assumed a client-facing full stack dev role developing core IP and integrated web apps, engaging in consulting projects, and providing leadership to more junior colleagues.
My responsibilities keep me constantly engaged in the balance of simultaneous projects, client communications, enhancement and support requests, code reviews, demos, discussions, interviews, etc, and we primarily use Python, React/JavaScript, CSS/LESS, Git, with Jira for agile project management.
Early on, I took joint-ownership of Glint, an incredibly cool key full stack UI project with total visibility internally and externally. Contributing heavily to its growth, working closely with management, and teaching, supporting, managing, working with and learning from the junior members of the team we hired to take Glint further has acted as a reflection of full product development.
My role thankfully permits the freedom to work with and move between multiple internal/external teams, self-direct and prioritise, and engage management at all levels. I am also fortunate enough to be able to learn from the incredibly smart, driven group of individuals that make Beacon."
